# Quiz Game

## Overview
The Quiz Game is a Python-based interactive quiz that tests users on various topics through multiple-choice questions loaded from an external file. This design allows for easy updates and customization of the quiz content.
Users interact with the game in the terminal, where they are prompted to answer questions with options ranging from A to D. The game tracks the user's score, providing immediate feedback on their answers, and displays the 
total score at the end of the quiz. This simple yet engaging project is perfect for beginners looking to practice working with file input/output, functions, and basic Python programming concepts.
